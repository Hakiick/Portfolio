### Overview of the bot:

To understand the functionality and design rationale behind the bot, we need to first provide a brief overview of the game, Bombcrypto. Bombcrypto is a play-to-earn game inspired by the classic Bomberman concept. However, it differentiates itself by introducing a unique twist: players can earn BCOIN, an in-game cryptocurrency, by breaking chests containing characters. These characters are represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), each possessing distinct combat characteristics and a unique identifier. The game operates on the blockchain, incorporating an AI that plays the game on behalf of players. This integration of AI becomes essential as Bombcrypto aims to combine both entertainment and profit, enabling players to leverage the unique NFT characters to earn.

Given that access to the game is paid, and the primary goal for players is to maximize their earnings, developers have allowed the use of a bot. This decision is made to maintain fairness and prevent disparities between players who can actively launch their characters and those who have invested in the game but may be occupied elsewhere. Furthermore, the bot offers the convenience of being active even during nighttime hours, ensuring that players do not miss out on potential earnings.


### Gameplay :

So, what is the daily routine for a Bombcrypto player? The characters in the game have energy levels, and to engage in chest-breaking activities, a character must possess sufficient energy. Players need to manage their characters by sending them to attack when they have energy and recharge or rest them when energy is depleted. To do this, players must log into the game. Importantly, players must keep the game window active, as heroes will only be active and regain energy when the game window remains open. If the game window is suspended, even if heroes are technically "active," they will not work and will not recharge their energy, rendering them ineffective. Each player can have a maximum of 15 characters on their team.
