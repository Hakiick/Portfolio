## Overview of the game:

In order to explain what the bot does and why it was designed this way, let's start with a
brief presentation of the game.
Bombcrypto is a game based on the concept of the Bomberman game, with the big difference that
Bombcrypto is play-to-earn where the objective is
to break chests with characters in order to collect BCOIN (in-game cryptocurrency). THE
NFT (non-fungible token) are its little characters here
allowing you to make money, they are called non-fungible because each hero is unique,
distinguishing in particular by different combat characteristics
and a different identifier. The game is developed on the blockchain. It is an AI integrated into the game which
plays the games, the Bombcrypto player is content
to launch the characters to attack the chests, however, access to the game being paid, and the objective
goal of each player being to make money, it
was allowed by the developers to play with a bot to avoid inequalities between players
who have time to launch their characters and those
having invested in the game and finding themselves at work. Also, the bot obviously allows you to be
launched during the night, allowing you not to lose any winnings
potential.
So, what exactly should the player do each day? The characters have different
characteristics, so that a character can attack
chests it must have energy, so if the character has energy it must be sent to attack,
if it runs out, you have to recharge it and put it
at rest. For this you must of course first connect to the game, and the subtlety and that it is necessary
keep the game window active so that the heroes are active, if the game window is in
suspends and the heroes are “active”, they will not work, and will not recover
energy, rendering them useless. You cannot put more than 15 characters on your team.
Several strategies have been studied in order to optimize gains, two of them stand out from the
others:
The first is to strategically dispatch characters based on one of their
attributes, or rarity.
The second is to send all the heroes


## Objective of the project :

The objective of the project is to create an autoclicker bot for an NFT game called BombCrypto.
Technological choice:
The project will be coded in Python, for its well-known modules in image detection, here we
We will mainly use opencv2. The code editor used is Visual Studio Code.
Provisional schedule:
Sprint 1: Made a functional bot on my personal machine, without image recognition,
only using positions given to a click.
Sprint 2: Make image detection possible
Sprint 3: Implement the bot in a Windows virtual machine so as not to be bothered by
actions of it.
Sprint 4: Configure a Debian Linux virtual machine to make bot usage less
energy and resource intensive.
Sprint 5: Make the project adaptable for machines other than mine
