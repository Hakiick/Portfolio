FakedIndeed is a jobboard web application developed by Maxime SARRAZIN and Lucas FIXARI for an Epitech project. It's designed to serve as a platform where companies can post job offers, and individuals can apply to those job offers. The website is built using Next.js, PHPMyAdmin for the database, and several dependencies.

## Features : 


    User Registration/Login: Users can register as either individuals or companies. Logging in is required to access various features.

    Individual Profile: Individual users can complete their profiles with personal information, which is automatically filled in when applying for jobs.

    Company Profiles: Companies can post job offers, view job applicants, and edit their profiles. Admins can manage companies and their information.

    Admin Panel: Admins have access to an admin panel where they can add, edit, and delete companies, user profiles, and job offers.
